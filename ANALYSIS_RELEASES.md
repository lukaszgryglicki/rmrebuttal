We can see that project evelved from single company (or double at most) to 9 - which means 10 top contributors work for 9 different companies.
The avg number of companies for Top 10 developers is 4.6. Current value is 9.

This means that Kubernetes is not company locked at least from about v1.3.

# Percent of Top 10 contributions versus all contributions per release

The number of contributions from top 10 contributors is dropping steadily from 47% to just about 15% in last releases:

- before v1.0: 47.7%

# Analysis of % of top N contributors.

Chart is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dK7h8i62G7JEtTrJ2XEYoX0vInEoA7lW0m9ssl5bXag/edit#gid=552729681).

We can clearly see that project evolved from almost single company and very few contributors to a multi company community.

We can see it especially in this [data sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dK7h8i62G7JEtTrJ2XEYoX0vInEoA7lW0m9ssl5bXag/edit#gid=609040480):

For June 2014:
 
- About 30% contributions were from a single contributor.
- 59% from two contributors. So more than 50% contributions come from just two contributors.
- 67.8% from top 3.
- 80.6% from top 5.
- 89% from top 10.
- 95% from top 20.
- 99.9% from top 50.
- 100% is reported for top 100.

for April 2016 (about halfway) it was:
- 4.26% for the top contributor.
- 8.40% for top two.
- 11.48% for top 3.
- 17.20% for top 5.
- 27.69% for top 10.
- 36.52% for top 15.
- 43.09% for top 20.
- 48.76% for top 25.
- 53.30% for top 30. So about 50% contributions comes from about 30 contributors.
- 66.44% for top 50.
- 80.29% for top 100.
- 90.27% for top 200.
- 100.0% for top 500.

For March 2018 those numbers are:

- 2.63% from the top contributor.
- 4.58% from two top contributors.
- 6.34% from top 3.
- 9.61% from top 5.
- 15.55% from top 10.
- 20.20% from top 15.
- 23.98% from top 20.
- 27.07% from top 25.
- 29.83% from top 30.
- 38.64% from top 50.
- 52.39% from top 100. So about 50% of contributions comes from 100 distinct contributors.
- 65.81% from top 200.
- 80.75% from top 500.
- We still didn't get to 100%.

You can see those numbers [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dK7h8i62G7JEtTrJ2XEYoX0vInEoA7lW0m9ssl5bXag/edit#gid=609040480).

Numbers of distinct [companies for the top N contributors](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dK7h8i62G7JEtTrJ2XEYoX0vInEoA7lW0m9ssl5bXag/edit#gid=1798859845) are as [follows](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dK7h8i62G7JEtTrJ2XEYoX0vInEoA7lW0m9ssl5bXag/edit#gid=1384928858):

For June 2014 it was:

- 2 companies for top 5 contributors (account for 80% contributions). Basically Kubernetes belongs to 2 comapanies atm.
- 4 companies for top 10 contributors, which is 89% of contributions.
- 7 companies for top 20 which gives 95% of contributions.
- 18 companies for top 50 which is 99.9% of commits
- The same number 18 for top 500 which is 100%.

For April 2016 (about halfway) it was:
- 1 company for top 5 contributors. 17.2% contributions.
- 2 companies for top 10 contributors, 27.69% contributions.
- 3 companies for top 25 contributors, 48.76% contributions (so about 50% of contributions are from 3-4 companies)
- 4 companies for top 30 contributors, 53.3% of contributions.
- 9 companies for top 50 contributors, about 66% of contributions.
- 25 companies for top 100 contributors, 80% contributions. So majority of contributions comes from about 25 companies.
- 51 companies for top 200 contributors, 90% of contributions.
- A bit more 55 companies for the top 500 contributors, about 100% of contributions.

For March 2018 it is:
- 4 companies for top 5 contributors, which is about 9.6% of contributions. So full diversity here.
- 8 companies from top 10 contributors (so almost all different companies), which is about 15.5% contributions. Full diversity here.
- 9 companies for the top 15 contributors, this is about 20.2% of contributions. Same here.
- 12 companies for the top 20 contributors, about 24% of contributions - no changes.
- 13 companies for the top 25 contributors, about 27% of contributions. We still have less than 2 people/company on average here and still only 27% of all contributions here.
- 14 companies for the top 30 contributors, about 30% of contributions. About 2 persons/company on average, 14 companies and only 30% of all contributions.
- 20 companies for the top 50 contributors, about 37% of all contributions. 2.5 person/company. Still diverse.
- 33 companies for the top 100 contributors, about 52.4% of all contributions. Here we have about 100 contributors for 33 different companies contributing 50% of Kubernetes code. Very different from the beginning.
- 44 companies for top 200 contributors, account for 66% of all contributions.
- 99 companies for top 500 contributors, account for 81% of all contributions. Still about 5 person/company, and only 80% of contributions covered.

We can say that kubernetes is a very multi-company project now.

# Quarterly analysis

Percent of total contributions for Top N contributors is constantly going down.
See chart [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dK7h8i62G7JEtTrJ2XEYoX0vInEoA7lW0m9ssl5bXag/edit#gid=164151852).

Number of contribuiting companies for Top N contributors is rising constantly, see chart [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dK7h8i62G7JEtTrJ2XEYoX0vInEoA7lW0m9ssl5bXag/edit#gid=1029945304).
Values for Top 100 and Top 200 are not strictly rising, which means that there is less than 100 distinct companies that makes most of the contributions now.

# CNCF join analysis

Analysing project stats before and after joining CNCF we can see:

Before joining CNCF:

- 6.6% contributions were made by the the most active single contributor. It is 1/15 of all contributions.
- 11% contributions were made by just two contributors. This is 1/9 of all contributions.
- 15.8% contributors were made by top 3 contributors from single company.
- 22.5% contributions were made by top 5 contributors from 2 companies.

# Kubernetes contributions analysis 

This is the combined [chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tdHqydcDQ7bUWMxHbYADiLmym2UBFcDTUDPCCfRNJuc/edit#gid=485224280) of per committer, per company analysis of Kubernetes contributions in quarters from 2nd quarter of 2014.

- It clearly shows dropping of Top N contributors percent of all contributions:
  - Top 1 shows drop of most active conbutors percent of contributions from 31% to 2%.
  - Top 5 drops from 81% to 8%.
  - Top 10 drops from 89% to 13% (and shows most dramatic drop, from very major contributions 90% to just quite small 13%).
  - Top 30 from 97% to 27% this is something like the "middle trend line".
  - Top 100 drops from 100% (which means there was less than 100 contributors at the beginning) to about 50% (half of the entire project now is done by 100 contributors).
  - Finally Top 1000, just to show that we reached this level, and 85% of all contribution made by 1000 contributors, but still 15% of project is done by tail after first 1000!

- The few lines for Top N contributing companies:
  - Top 1 show drop of single compnay controlling project (85% at the beginning) to just 20%.
  - Top 2 companies show drop from 90% to 32%.
  - Top 10 companies (which was 100% before July 2014) now accounts for 50% (half of all contributions).
  - About April 2015 we crossed 50 different companies, and now they account for 67% of contributions (not included top 100 or more, because here we don't have too much accurate data, we will never reach 100% due to missing affiliations, so top 50 is just about limit of our data atm).

- Finally just 3 series that use right y axis (to show number for contributions data shown in 1 and 2):
  - Number of distinct contributors per given quarter.
  - Number of distinct contributing companies per given quarter.
  - Average number of contributions/day in a given quarter.
